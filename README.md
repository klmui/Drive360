## Summary

Drive 360 helps students in driver’s education classes learn the rules of driving by immersing them into interactive VR environments. It also provides a mobile-platform for users to post tips, take practice exams, share practice sets, and learn.

## Abstract/Introduce App

1.  “16-year olds have higher crash rates than drivers of any age”. With new advances in VR technology, people have sought to use it for educational purposes. In this case, we will use it to help people drive by providing an immersive VR experience.
    
2.  Users will be asked questions while the video is going on. The 360 video will pause when the app wants the user to complete a task. For example, to continue the 360 video, users will be required to look left, right, and left while they are at a stop sign, shoulder check while merging onto a highway or changing lanes, and look at mirrors when performing actions. Users will also be able to take a 360 tour of the inside of a car to get familiar with it.
    
3.  It is understandable that some people might be scared to get started with learning how to drive. The transition from reading manuals and rule books to actually driving the car might be uneasy for beginners. Aiming to alleviate the fear some might have, the app targets teenagers at the age of learning how to drive as well as people having anxious feelings while driving.

## Mobile innovation

The app is very mobile-driven innovative since it focuses on turning tedious driving tutorials into a more interactive and dynamic platform that excites the users and encourages their engagement with the app.  This app can be used in driver’s education classes and as a learning resource for people learning how to drive since the equipment is not too expensive for classrooms.

## VR Wireframes Description

1.  A description of the 'flow' of your app. This should describe how users will navigate between the VR Videos and the interactive experiences:

    When users load the Android app, they will be presented with a big button that says “Drive”. Once they click that button, they will be loaded into a “VR lobby”. If they want to go back into the Android application, they can just click the back button on their Android device. The VR lobby includes cubes with labels for each driving scenario. If the user looks at a certain cube for a couple of seconds, that scenario will play.

2.  A description of each of the different locations/activities that you will make VR videos in/about:

    One of our team members, Monica, has a car. So we probably meet together and take VR videos while driving on the highway and in residential areas. We plan to have a camera with 360 capability facing the driving direction and simulate different driving scenarios. We also plan on taking a 360 picture in Monica’s car so users can interact with it and see where things are located.

3.  A description of each of the VR experiences you are going to create:
    We plan to simulate the following scenarios:
-   Driving on highway
-   Driving with snow weather
-   Driving in rain weather
-   Encountering traffic signs and road signs

4.  A description of the heads-up display elements:

    We will set up the camera to face the road to simulate driving experience. The user using VR app will look mostly to the front, which focuses on the road. However, since we are going to use a camera with 360 capability, the user has options to look around, checking the left and right side and turning around to look at the back. The app will require the user to do shoulder checks and make sure that they are clear to pass each intersection.

## Milestone 1 (Due March 15th)

-   Record 360 videos for merging onto the highway and lane changing.
